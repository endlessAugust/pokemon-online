During effect, user uses this attack during each of its turns and can't take any other action. [When user uses this attack this way during the last round of the effect, it becomes confused at the end of that round], unless it's already confused. Effect ends without causing confusion if this attack's type is ineffective against opponent's types [before the last round of the effect], if user is prevented from using this attack, or when user falls asleep, becomes frozen, or is replaced [before the last round of the effect]. If user is asleep, this attack deals damage and lasts one turn (doesn't cause confusion).
201 Weather. Lasts for five rounds including the current round.

202 If this attack is successful, user gains half of HP lost by opponent due to this attack.
203 Until the end of the round, if an attack by non-users would reduce user's HP to less than 1, its damage is changed so that it reduces user's HP to 1 instead.

Effect ends and X is reset to 0 when user is replaced; when this attack is prevented from being used, misses, or becomes ineffective; when the attack is used for five turns; or when user falls asleep or becomes frozen. This attack's power is multiplied by 2 to the power of X. If user is asleep, this attack's effect lasts one turn.

206 If this attack's damage would be equal to or greater than opponent's current HP, its damage is instead equal to opponent's current HP minus 1. (This attack doesn't fail if 0 damage would be dealt this way.)
207 If opponent's Attack can be increased, increases opponent's Attack by 2 stages. If opponent is not confused, confuses opponent.
