/*
    This is what is used to communicate with the outside.

    You send data with send(), and the signal isFull() warns you when a message arrived.



    Here are the details you don't need to know:

    Actually the protocol is here: the first two bytes represent the length of the message (in a 256 numerical base), and then
    there's the message.

    The first byte is therefore length() / 256, and the second length() % 256.

    The drawback to that mini-protocol is that you cannot send data longer than (256*256 - 1), but it's not really a drawback, its more like
    a security.
